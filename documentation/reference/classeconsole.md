# ClassEConsole

The console module can be used for debugging purposes. When you enable the console for Windows desktop, a new window appears in which you can add lines of text. This can be useful to show more information about the state of the program. When the console is turned off, it isn't necessary to disable function calls.

This module should be called through the [ECD structure](ecd.md).

# ClassEConnect

The network connectivity module can be used for setting up platform independent network connections using TCP/IP (including WiFi, GPRS and UMTS) and Bluetooth. It contains functions for creating client and host connections to send and receive network data.

Note: EDGELIB currently only supports the Microsoft Bluetooth stack on Windows Mobile. This Bluetooth stack is commonly implemented on Windows Mobile Smartphones with Bluetooth and some Pocket PCs. Bluetooth is currently not supported on the iPhone platform due to SDK restrictions. Also, Bluetooth on Linux desktop is currently not implemented.

This module should be called through the ECD structure.

# Completing the game

## Possible enhancements
This is the end of the tutorial on how to program a simple game using EDGELIB. It can be a good exercise to expand this sample project to get more familiar with the EDGELIB framework, and to see the possibilities EDGELIB has to offer.

Possible improvements are:

* Creating more visual enhancements, like more particle effects, a scrolling background, better animations, etc.
* Adding a shield to the player spaceship
* Adding more powerups and different enemies
* Adding sound effects and music
* Adding multi-player/network capabilities

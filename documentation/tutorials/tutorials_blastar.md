This tutorial will be a step-by-step guide on how to write a simple game using EDGELIB. It covers several steps in the development process, and by the last chapter you'll have a working game that's able to run on several devices. Every step will be described, from the design phase to having a working game on a mobile device.

The result of this tutorial can be downloaded at the last chapter and can be found in the samples folder of the EDGELIB SDK.

On the right you can see a screenshot of the game in action.

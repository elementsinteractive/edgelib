# Multi-platform development

Developing for multiple platforms at once can be challenging, but it usually pays off at the end. It makes developing efficient, and it will keep every version updated (when working with one source code base).

This document will be a more non-technical view on how to develop for multiple platforms. It contains the following topics:

* [How to handle the limits of each platform](tutorials_multiplatform_limits.md)
* [The differences between the input of each device](tutorials_multiplatform_inputdifferences.md)
* [Creating graphics for multi-platform games](tutorials_multiplatform_graphics.md)
* [Handling of device-independent animations](tutorials_multiplatform_animations.md)

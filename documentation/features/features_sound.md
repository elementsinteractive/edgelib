# Sound

## Sound wrapper
As of EDGELIB 2.95, a sound wrapper is provided to embed sound playback from other libraries into your EDGELIB-powered project easily.

Load and play sound through the easy to use ClassESound interface.

The following sound wrappers are provided:

* Silent (default)
* [Hekkus Sound System](http://www.shlzero.com/wordpress/?page_id=4) for the multi-platform sound engine written by Thomas Maniero


## Sound playback effects
It's possible to add additional effects to your sound and music playback. These include: fade in, fade out and cross fade effects. Also it's possible to adjust pitch and panning when playing sound effects.

Adding these effects is easy through the ClassESound interface.

Note: Supported effects depend on the sound library and sound wrapper.

EDGELIB is easy to use and a new project can be set up in a short amount of time. The SDK includes extensive documentation for each component with a detailed description for every class and function. Creating multi-platform projects has never been easier!

Save time producing high-quality applications with EDGELIB and reduce budget costs for each project. Use sample projects and tutorials to get started quickly.

## High-performance
EDGELIB is designed specifically to create high-speed applicationd and games for a variety of mobile platforms.

The core is written from scratch in C++ and contains a high-performance graphics engine, optimized for each platform. The engine doesn't use slow floating point variables, and keeps divisions at a minimum.

It's also possible to take advantage of DirectDraw for Windows Mobile 5 and Windows Desktop to increase performance even more! This will use the hardware accelerated features of the videocard, and can be implemented by a simple configuration option in EDGELIB.

EDGELIB is highly optimized for several opacity values other than just 50%, namely: 6,25%, 12,5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 87,5% and 93,75%. This enables more flexibility when optimized opacity blending is needed.

## Production-proven
Developed from scratch by mobile game developers, EDGELIB has been proven to produce commercial games of high quality for multiple platforms. There are finished EDGELIB-powered games available in several genres: platformers, multi-player puzzle games and space shooters.

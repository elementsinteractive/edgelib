# Getting started with Symbian

This tutorial will get you started with Symbian development. It contains the following chapters:

* [Installation](gettingstarted_symbian_installation.md)
* [Commandline project](gettingstarted_symbian_cmdproject.md)
* [The C++ source file](gettingstarted_symbian_sourcefile.md)
* [Symbian installations](gettingstarted_symbian_sisfiles.md)
* [Symbian security](gettingstarted_symbian_security.md)
* [Application UID](gettingstarted_symbian_appuid.md)

## Important
Self-signed certificates for Symbian 9 applications generated by Carbide and the makekeys utility are only valid for one year. To generate a self-signed certificate you need OpenSSL. Here is an example to create a long-lasting (20 years) self-signed certificate using OpenSSL:

```c++
openssl genrsa 1024 > sign.key 
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 7300 -key sign.key > sign.cert
```

The EDGELIB Buillder tool (previously called Edge IDE) contains examples of 20-year certificate files.

## Notes
Before Symbian version 9 a typical Symbian application could not use global variables. Also, Symbian installation files should be created as small as possible, as most older Symbian phones have a small amount of memory. Try to keep the installation file intended for older Symbian phones smaller than about 1MB. These are the limits to keep in mind when developing applications for Symbian.

# Required hardware and software

## Apple hardware
Currently it's only possible to develop on Apple Mac hardware when targeting the iPhone device. For example, this can be a Mac iBook or a MacMini. A Wifi access point can be useful when developing network applications. Also it is used to access your iPhone device wirelessly. Copy the EDGELIB installation folder to your Mac development workstation.

## Downloading the iPhone SDK
Obtain the iPhone SDK from the [iPhone Dev Center](http://developer.apple.com/iphone). This will require you to register an Apple ID. You can also use your existing Apple ID if you have one. After logging in you can download the iPhone SDK to your Mac device. The SDK comes with the XCode programming environment and all iPhone headers and libraries. When the SDK is installed, you're able to develop for the iPhone simulator. To develop for a real device you need to become a registered iPhone developer.

## Becoming a registered iPhone developer
The first step is to apply for the iPhone developer program. On the iPhone Dev Center, click on the 'start now' link to become a registered iPhone developer. Then continue and click on the "Learn more" link. Choose to become part of the standard or enterprise program and apply for an account. Once approved, you will be contacted by Apple. When you have access to the iPhone developer program, you can create a vendor ID and application IDs. Those are needed to sign your applications and run them on an actual iPhone device.

# EDGELIB Tile Scanner

The EDGELIB Tile Scanner tool is able to scan an image for tiles, find duplicates and write files to implement a tile set in your game. This tool will only be useful if duplicate tiles can be found within the image, otherwise the tile set will be as big as the original image. More info in the [tutorial](../../documentation/tutorials/tutorials_tilescanner.md).
